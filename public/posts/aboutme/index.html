NSF-Ramp Postbaccalaureate Researcher | Evo-devo, genetics
Hello! My name is Ethan, I&rsquo;m a post-baccalaureate researcher at the Yuan Lab at the University of Connecticut where I am studying genomics and evo-devo biology. My research is currently focused on using CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing to study how promoter mutations affect floral development and phenotypic diversity. For non-science people, that means that I&rsquo;m editing plant genes to see how they affect growth/what they look like! I am a recent graduate from UMass Amherst, where I majored in Biology and minored in jazz performance.">

<p>Hello! My name is Ethan, I&rsquo;m a post-baccalaureate researcher at the Yuan Lab at the University of Connecticut where I am studying genomics and evo-devo biology. My research is currently focused on using CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing to study how promoter mutations affect floral development and phenotypic diversity.

I am a recent graduate from UMass Amherst, where I majored in Biology and minored in jazz performance.</p>
<p>I love all things biology, but my research interests are in genetics/genomics, developmental biology, evolution, and biodiversity. However, I also have experience in bioinformatics, data science, proteomics, embryology, and phylogenetics using a wide array of model systems (Nematostella, Xenopus, and Mimulus, to name a few!).</p>
<p>My passion for science has also driven my interest in science education and communication, as well as diversity in the science community.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love any opportunity to connect with you to talk about collaborations, opportunities, or just anything science! Feel free to contact me here or at <a href="mailto:ethanni12@gmail.com">ethanni12@gmail.com</a>.</p>
<p>Thank you and have a beautiful day! :)</p>
