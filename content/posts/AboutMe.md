# Ethan Ni
## *NSF-Ramp Postbaccalaureate Researcher | Evo-devo, genetics*
---
Hello! My name is Ethan, I'm a post-baccalaureate researcher at the Yuan Lab at the University of Connecticut where I am studying genomics and evo-devo biology. My research is currently focused on using CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing to study how promoter mutations affect floral development and phenotypic diversity. For non-science people, that means that I'm editing plant genes to see how they affect growth/what they look like! I am a recent graduate from UMass Amherst, where I majored in Biology and minored in jazz performance.

I love all things biology, but my research interests are in genetics/genomics, developmental biology, evolution, and biodiversity. However, I also have experience in bioinformatics, data science, proteomics, embryology, and phylogenetics using a wide array of model systems (Nematostella, Xenopus, and Mimulus, to name a few!). 

My passion for science has also driven my interest in science education and communication, as well as diversity in the science community. 

I'd love any opportunity to connect with you to talk about collaborations, opportunities, or just anything science! Feel free to contact me here or at ethanni12@gmail.com.

Thank you and have a beautiful day! :smiley:
